python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
$.env.sample as this sample is proivded then used in 
your .env 
```

### 5. Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations

python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser


```

### 6. Run Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver

The production link:
https://smart-notification-system-nxi5.onrender.com/api/swagger/
For admin :
https://smart-notification-system-nxi5.onrender.com/admin/


## üê≥ Docker Setup

### Build and Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t notifyhub .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e DEBUG=True notifyhub


#for the compose run 

Run with: `docker-compose up -d`

```

## üìÑ Design Decisions

### 1. Signals for Notification Triggers
Django signals (`post_save`, etc.) were used to decouple event logic from core functionality. For example, triggering notifications on events like user login or comment creation is handled via thorugh notification preference and its deliver to user, making the codebase more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

**Benefit**: Promotes loose coupling between business logic and notification system.

### 2. Initialization for Notification Types
Notification types (e.g., `new_login`, `weekly_summary`, `new_comment`) are initialized via custom Django data migrations instead of manual admin entry or seed scripts.

**Benefit**: Ensures consistent and repeatable setup across environments (development, staging, production) without requiring manual configuration.


### 3. Separated Models for Notification Types, Preferences, and Deliveries
The system uses distinct models for:
- `NotificationType`: Defines what kinds of events can trigger notifications.
- `NotificationPreference`: Stores user-level preferences for each notification type and channel.
- `NotificationDelivery`: Tracks each actual delivery attempt (status, channel, timestamp).

**Benefit**: Improves scalability, simplifies querying, and cleanly supports multi-channel delivery logic.


### 4. Custom User Model
A custom user model was used to ensure flexibility for future enhancements such as email login, or user profiles.

**Benefit**: Future-proofs the system while aligning with more features.


### 5. Mock Email and SMS Channels
Since the system uses mocked services for these channels . Delivery logs still track them as if they were real.

**Benefit**: Keeps local setup simple while simulating real-world flows.

### 6. Role-Based Access and Permissions
Sensitive actions like triggering system wide events are protected via permission checks to ensure only admin users can perform them.

**Benefit**: Security and integrity in notification handling.


### 7. DRF-Spectacular for API Documentation
`drf-spectacular` was chosen for its tight integration with Django REST Framework and automatic schema generation. It supports both Swagger and ReDoc UIs.

**Benefit**: Provides clear, interactive API docs for developers and testers.



### 8. CKEditor5 for Rich Text Notifications
Rich content notifications (especially for email) benefit from formatted text. CKEditor5 was integrated for creating and managing content-rich messages in admin.

**Benefit**: Allows admin to create visually appealing notifications with formatting and media.


### 9. Jazzmin for Admin Customization
The default Django admin is enhanced using the **Jazzmin** theme to provide a modern, clean, and user friendly interface. This makes managing users, notification types, preferences, and delivery logs more intuitive for admin users.

**Benefit**: Improves usability and aesthetics of the admin panel without requiring a custom frontend. Helps non-technical admins navigate and manage the system efficiently.

## üêõ Debug Logging

The project includes Django's built-in logging configuration, enhanced with custom debug-level logs to help developers monitor and troubleshoot the notification system. Logging is used to:

- Track when and how notification events are triggered
- Log delivery attempts across channels (in-app, email, SMS)
- Report failures and reasons during notification dispatch
- Capture key user actions (e.g., login, comment creation) when tied to events

```

## üìñ API Documentation

### Access Points

- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/api/swagger/`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/api/redoc/`
- **OpenAPI Schema**: `http://localhost:8000/api/`

### Authentication

The API uses JWT authentication. First, obtain tokens:

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/user/signup/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User"
  }'

# Login to get tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/user/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9",
  "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.",
  "is_staff": true
}
```

### Core API Endpoints
